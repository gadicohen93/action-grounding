The first step would be to power cycle the router by unplugging it, waiting for about 30 seconds, and then plugging it back in. If that doesn't resolve the issue, try the following steps:\n\n1. Check the physical connections between the router and the modem, making sure they are secure.\n\n2. Check the status lights on the router and modem. If the 'Internet' light on the router is off or flashing, there may be an issue with the connection to the modem.\n\n3. If the connection to the modem seems fine, try resetting the router to its factory settings by pressing the reset button on the back or bottom of the router. Be aware that this will erase all saved network settings, so you'll need to reconfigure the router after the reset.\n\n4. If the router still disconnects after these steps, it may be a hardware issue. In that case, I would recommend contacting TechCorp's technical support for further assistance.\n<|end_of_text|>", "tool_used": false, "tool_arg": null, "claims_action": false, "category": "honest_no_search"}
